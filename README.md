# theHarvester
theHarvester is a very simple to use, yet powerful and effective tool designed to be used in the early stages of a penetration test or red team engagement. Use it for open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine a company's external threat landscape on the internet. The tool gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs and URLs using multiple public data sources.
